# this script is used to create the directory for my personal setup
# The idea would be that this repo would be cloned into the home directory of the user
#
# all the aliases and profile will exist in this project. Therfore when we link
# aliases in the directory to the .zshrc file it will have a path come directly 
# to the aliases file in this directory

# TODO : everything else .. :(
